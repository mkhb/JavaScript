<h1>JavaScript Strings</h1>
<p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:</p>
<p id = 'demo'></p>
<script>
    var txt1 = "It's Alright";
    var txt2 = "He is called 'jhoy'";
    var txt3 = 'He is called "jhonny"';
    document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML= txt1 + "<br>" + txt2 + "<br>" + txt3;
